- [x] Why are forms used so often in web applications and software?
      They are one of the best ways for companies to gather data from their users, or to get your users to interact with your software. Needless to say, they are vital in the web landscape

- [x] What advantages are there by using a forms library like Formik?

      Nested form data and/or arrays
      Wiring up state
      Validation
      Error messages

- [x] What is stateful logic?
      Stateful logic is logic that is built into a component. It can be a function that handles a click event or a typing event, or maybe a function that sets toggle state, or even a logic that formats data passed to the component before it gets displayed. Usually this kind of logic deals with state in the component. Thus the moniker “stateful logic.”

- [x] What is a custom hook, and what does it mean to compose hooks together?
      Custom Hooks, so-called because you are building the hook yourself, allow you to apply non-visual behavior and stateful logic throughout your components by reusing the same hook over and over again. They follow the same patterns of naming that you’ve already learned (i.e. prefacing the function name with use, as in useState). You can build a reusable custom hook for uses as varied as handling controlled inputs, managing event listeners, and watching for key presses.
